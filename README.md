# Student-Attendance-Manager

This Java program is a student management system that allows users to create student profiles, enroll them in courses, and track their class attendance. The program collects a student's name, student ID (SID), and major, then provides options to enroll in and attend courses. It also calculates the student's average attendance percentage. Input validation ensures correct data entry, and the program interacts with the user via a console-based interface.
